# MyGamesList
[mygameslist.net](#)<br/>
This is my first full stack personal project where I try to create an app for users to manage their video game backlog. The idea for this project was inspired by MyAnimeList. The purpose of this project are as follows:

- Put into practice the web technologies I've learnt but never used in a real project (i.e. React, Bootstrap, etc.)
- Learn to implement common web functionality (i.e. Authentication, Session, etc.)
- Learn to build reasonably decent looking UI
- Understand how all the parts of web development fit together

## APIs used
- [Giantbomb API](https://www.giantbomb.com/api/) Used to query database of video games
